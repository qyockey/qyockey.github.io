    <h1>Asking for Help</h1>
    <i>or Another Excuse to Tell My Friends About Radio</i>
    <p>Written 2026-01-11</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
    In July of 2025, I upgraded my amateur radio operator's license from
    technician class to general class.
    This change gave me privileges to transmit on lower-frequency HF radio bands
    where signals can travel past the horizon.
    To start, I bought a simple dipole antenna and a "cheap" 40-year-old Kenwood
    TS-430S transceiver.
    I had listened to the incoming signals as soon as I got the radio, but it
    was until winter break that I finally got around to configuring my setup for
    transmission.
    </p>
    <p>
    After hanging my 33-foot antenna in a tree and properly tuning it, I was
    ready to go.
    I powered on my radio and immediately heard a station loud and clear from
    Anchorage Alaska, over 1700 miles from my Grandma's home in Southern Oregon.
    This was the furthest station I'd ever heard!
    I took a quick dinner break, then came back to the radio, excited to finally
    get on the air with HF...  and it didn't turn on.
    The frequency display was completely blank, and I was unable to hear
    anything but noise.
    Somehow, in the span of an hour, the radio went from perfectly functional to
    an overpriced paperweight.

    <h2>My Attempt at Identifying the Problem</h2>
    <p>
    To troubleshoot this issue, I did what I have been trained to do.
    I looked up the model of radio along with a relevant query hoping to find
    someone on the internet who solved the exact problem.
    And I did!
    I found several answers, actually, across Reddit, forums, and public mailing
    lists.
    One person replaced faulty electrolytic capacitors on the display board,
    another cleaned the contacts on a specific transistor on a seemingly
    unrelated portion of the circuit board.
    It seemed to be a different solution each time, and the more I read the more
    confused I got.
    I tried asking Gemini and the GPT, and they gave conflicting answers too.
    I was pretty well stumped.
    </p>
    <p>
    Then I had a pretty radical idea.
    What if I could just get a real human being with experience to take a look
    at my radio?
    This shouldn't have been that crazy to me, but being a self-taught
    programmer and Linux user, I've solved most of my computer problems by
    reading forum posts.
    I realized I was very nervous to reach out and ask for help.
    I identified two radio clubs and sent off emails in hope that someone
    knowledgeable would be able to inspect my radio in person and identify which
    solution would work for me.
    What I got was a whole lot more.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Getting Help</h2>
    <p>
    Miraculously, I got an email back from the president of the Rogue Valley
    Amateur Radio Club.
    <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/AG7GP">Amy AG7GP</a>
    was my first point of contact.
    Although she was not up for the task of troubleshooting my rig, she
    forwarded me to a friend of hers:
    <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/N7JI">Scott N7JI</a>,
    the technical advisor for University of Oregon's Amateur Radio Club. 
    Scott hypothesized the issue I was describing was caused by an issue with 
    the phase-locked loop (PLL) circuit becoming unlocked, but wasn't positive.
    To check, Scott brought in his friend
    <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/W7PL">Ken W7PL</a>,
    who runs a professional radio repair business.
    Ken's assessment was that this radio suffered from an issue common to many
    Kenwood radios of this era: over time, the substance used to coat the
    circuit boards gradually becomes electrically conductive, eventually ruining
    the circuitry.
    Even worse, it seeps into the circuit board, making it near impossible to
    remove.
    Ken's conclusion: my radio is toast and not worth repairing.
    I need to get a new radio.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Beyond Help</h2>
    <p>
    So that really sucks.
    I asked the email chain if any of them had any radio recommendations.
    Ken responds with an incredible offer: a free 6-month loan on one of his
    personal rigs, a
    <a href="https://www.rigpix.com/yaesu/ft450.htm">Yaesu FT-450</a>.
    We are currently in the process of setting a time to meet up, and I'm super
    excited to soon have a quality radio to get up to speed on.
    </p>

    <p>
    Scott was the next to make an offer.
    Every June, the SEAPAC Amateur Radio Convention comes to Seaside, OR.
    I was informed this is a great place to pick up starting equipment and
    encouraged to attend.
    Scott has a house in Seaside, and generously lets students lodge there for
    the big weekend.
    Without a car of my own, this would definitely make the trip much easier for
    me.
    Scott also offered a radio of his at a "pay what you think it's worth"
    discount.
    This was a great offer, but I don't need a second radio just yet.
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, Amy pitched in with an offer of her own.
    Amy is the leading operator in Oregon's <i>Summits On The Air</i> (SOTA)
    program.
    SOTA is a gamified program where operators get points for making radio
    contacts from on top of hills and mountains.
    Amy offered for me to tag along with her for a day of SOTA.
    This is a program I've been looking into, but I'd never gotten the
    opportunity to participate in.
    </p>

    <h2>Summits On The Air with Amy AG7GP</h2>
    <p>
    Amy selected New Year's Eve for our excursion date.
    Our first target was
    <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/W7O/CS-089">Bald Mountain W7O/CS-089</a>.
    After the difficult drive on a washed-out dirt road, Bald Mountain had a
    moderately short trail without any wild elevation.
    Amy and I set up my 20m dipole antenna on her collapsible fishing pole.
    She connected it to her Elecraft KX2 radio, powered by a lightweight 9V 3Ah
    Bioenno battery.
    Amy demonstrated the typical SOTA procedure:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Self-spot on <a href=https://sotawatch.sota.org.uk>SOTAwatch</a>.
        This creates a listing of the operating frequency, mode, and location,
        making it much easier to be found by other operators.
      </li>
      <li>
        Call CQ for other stations.
        "CQ" is a shorthand for "calling all stations".
      </li>
      <li>
        Once a station comes back, respond with their call to make sure you have
        it correct.
        Tell them the quality of their signal using the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-S-T_system">RST System</a>.
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Note the RST reading that they give you.
      </li>
      <li>
        If they are also participating in SOTA from another summit, give them
        the identifier code for your summit, and note theirs.
      </li>
      <li>
        This completes the exchange of all required information, but more
        conversation can of course be added if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        That's one contact.
        Rinse and repeat to your heart's content.
        Four contacts are required to receive credit for "activating" the
        summit.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
      Here's a simple example exchange between stations KK7ZZZ and N7YYY.
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>KK7ZZZ:</td>
        <td>
          "CQ CQ CQ, CQ Summits On The Air, CQ Summits On The Air, this is
          KK7ZZZ, kilo kilo seven zulu zulu zulu".
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>N7YYY:</td>
        <td>
          "Kilo kilo seven zulu zulu zulu, this is november seven yankee
          yankee yankee.  You're four and seven, four and seven in Western
          Montana."
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>KK7ZZZ:</td>
        <td>
          "November seven yankee yankee yankee, you're five and nine out of
          Souther Oregon, fifty-nine."
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>N7YYY:</td>
        <td>"Good to hear, thank you for the contact."</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>KK7ZZZ:</td>
        <td>"Thanks for the contact, 73."</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

        A sample from my log book.
        The information I save is the
        frequency band (ex. 20m, 2m),
        operation mode (ex SSB, FM),
        time of contact (in 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">
          UTC</a>),
        call sign of the operator,
        their location (sometimes),
        received signal quality (RST),
        reported quality of transmitted signal (RST),
        and their summit code if also participating in SOTA.

    <p>
    I had it pretty easy here.
    Amy called CQ, worked each contact, and then passed the mic over to me.
    All I had to do was to not panic, which is a lot easier said than done.
    After a few contacts I started to get the rhythm, and my nerves began to
    subside.
    </p>

    <p>
    Phone signals (like I was using) contain lots of information in order to
    reconstruct an approximation of voice audio on the receiver's end.
    Since radio signals degrade in quality the further they travel, the voice
    information can get jumbled up quickly.
    On the other hand, a Morse Code (referred to by hams as CW for "continuous
    wave") signal has far less information: just a simple on or off.
    This means that CW is more resilient against degradation, and can travel
    farther before becoming unrecognizable.
    All of my contacts were in the western US: Southern California, Northern
    Washington, and Central Montana.
    When Amy worked several CW contacts, her range was much further, reaching
    Colorado, Texas, Tennessee, and Alabama.
    She told me that on good days, she's reached as far as Japan and New
    Zealand!
    </p>

    <p>
    After a quick lunch, we headed down the road to 
    <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/W7O/CS-105">Point Mountain W7O/CS-105</a>.
    The hike here was a lot steeper.
    At the end, we had to cut off the trail to reach the summit, and needed to
    switchback across the hill to stay upright.
    At the summit, we used her linked dipole antenna this time.
    It is normally resonant on the 40 meter band, but can be easily adjusted to
    20m, 17m, 15m, 12m, or 10m by just unplugging the corresponding connector
    along the wire, changing its length.
    This is a really simple but impressive way to utilize multiple bands on a
    portable antenna, and I'm thinking that I might have to make this
    modification to my dipole as a future project.

    On Point Mountain, Amy increased the difficulty for me.
    She called CQ, but when several stations came back, she had me work all of
    them consecutively.
    This was stressful, but really fun!
    When I stumbled, Amy was still available to help me with what to say.
    As I got more comfortable, she let me take control while she stepped away
    and worked local contacts on a Quansheng UV-K5 handheld transceiver.
    Then it got really chaotic when we were both bouncing back and forth between
    the two radios!
    The contacts themselves became pretty straightforward, but I struggled most
    with writing down all the information I needed while keeping up the
    conversation.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
    Normally, when I find a problem, I can usually find someone online who has
    successfully been able to solve it.
    This is good in the case of simple issues, but the case of my radio was far
    from simple.
    I was quite nervous to reach out to local clubs for help, but I'm very glad
    I did.
    The amateur radio community is very supportive of new operators, and I got
    to experience that firsthand.
    That's something that internet searches just can't replace.
    SOTA was a blast, and I learned a ton having Amy as a mentor.
    I'm incredibly grateful to Amy, Scott, and Ken for their help and generous
    offers.
