    <h1>I'm Making a Website!</h1>
    <p>Written 2025-12-22</p>

    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
    Look Mom!
    I'm making a website!
    I'm on the internet now and I'm gonna be famous!
    </p>

    <p>
    For a while now, I've been reading blog posts from my friend and former
    coworker <a href="https://lukaswerner.com">Lukas Werner</a>, and I've really
    enjoyed his content.
    He has notes on various topics, tutorials, opinions, and photos
    (<i>you should check his site out!</i>).
    After one long session grading exams for our TA job, Lukas and I hung around
    the Kelley Engineering Center chatting together.
    Eventually, he convinced me to create a personal website of my own.
    I had to think about it for a while, but I ultimately realized it would be a
    great project.

    <h2>Ideas</h2>

    <p>
    I have several ideas for how I might use this site.
    </p>

    <p>
    I'm planning to create some learning resources to document tools I use.
    As a TA, I saw lots of cases where electrical engineering and computer
    science students could really benefit from knowing a powerful text editor
    like Vim.
    One of my first planned articles is to document how I would learn Vim if I
    could start over again.
    </p>

    <p>
    I think it would be a great to talk about hobbies and other things I do in
    my personal life.
    I've been getting more and more interested in amateur radio, and when I
    finally get on the air I imagine I'll have quite a bit to share.
    </p>

    <p>
    Recently, I've also taken efforts to step away from my phone, and that has
    caused a lot of positive change for me.
    As I continue to work on my digital detox, this site will give me a place to
    document my process and results.
    </p>

    <p>
    I want to write about simplicity.
    Why am I writing this page in plain HTML without javascript?
    Why do I use the tools and environment I use?
    Why do I look backwards in time for technological inspiration?
    </p>

    <p>
    I have silly opinions that I want to share.
    Why did I switch to taking my class notes in cursive?
    Why do I insist on writing the date YYYY-MM-DD?
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
    I'm very excited to begin using this site.
    I've always enjoyed content from the early web, and I think a blog is the
    perfect way for me to keep that spirit alive.
    I'm not looking to get as many views as possible -- quite the opposite:
    I want a low stakes place to share some thoughts,
    and have small but meaningful interactions with visitors.
    </p>

    <p>
    This will definitely take some getting used to.
    I have a tendency to want everything perfect, so I often find it's hard to
    even get started writing.
    Plus, being a full time student and part-time employee, other activities
    demand lots of my time.
    Don't expect new articles too frequently.
    </p>

    <p>
    One of the things that struck me about Lukas' blog was how human it felt,
    and I'm hoping I can achieve something similar here.
    Amidst a net full of the latest and greatest innovations, corporate
    products, and AI slop, I just want to ramble about old tech and whatever
    else is on my mind :-)
