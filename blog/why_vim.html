    <h1>Why Learn Vim?  And How?</h1>
    <p>Written 2025-12-22</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
    I often find myself recommending Vim to my peers at Oregon State University.
    I have created this document as a reference to direct people to in order to
    help them discover and gain proficiency with Vim.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
    I have been actively using Vim for the past 4 years now.
    I use Vim pretty much any time I write text: coding, drafting emails,
    writing web pages for this blog, etc.
    Vim is an extremely powerful and feature-packed text editor developed to
    maximize efficiency of editing files.
    There is a notoriously steep learning curve, but for those of us that edit
    lots of text, the reward is immense.
    <b>
    If you are a computer scientist or electrical engineer, you will edit plain
    text for the rest of your career, so it is worth learning a tool to edit
    plain text fast!
    </b>
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Limitations of Classic Editors</h2>
    <p>
    Many people I have spoken with haven't put much thought into the editor they
    use.
    Some pick the default editor provided to them, others choose an
    <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr> with an
    intuitive interface.
    This allows for a comfortable editing experience, but sacrifices the ability
    to rapidly make complex changes.
    Manipulation is where Vim shines.
    These changes are often repetitive: rename all occurrences of a variable,
    indent each line a block of code, append a semicolon to several lines, etc.
    Where other editors only support changing text in one place at a time,
    Vim is <i>designed around</i> making multiple changes at the same time.
    And when only single changes need to be made, Vim's motions allow for
    lightning-fast movement throughout your files.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    On Linux, install <code>vim</code> from your distribution's package manager
    or <a href="https://www.vim.org/git.php">compile from source</a>.
    For Mac or Windows, see Vim's official
    <a href="https://www.vim.org/download.php">download page</a>.

    <hr>
    <h2 id=learn>How to Learn Vim</h2>
    <p>
    So, how can you start learning this powerful tool?
    Packaged alongside Vim, there's an
    <b>incredible resource: <i>VimTutor</i></b>.
    To access the VimTutor on Linux, simply run <code>vimtutor</code> in your
    terminal.
    Mac and Windows should have similar functionality.
    This teaches the basics of the editor, covering the fundamentals first so
    that you can get up and <s>running</s> moving as fast as possible.
    The estimated time to complete the tutorial is 30 minutes, but it may well
    take longer.
    There's a lot of information, so don't worry about getting everything right
    away.
    For now, focus on taking away the basics of file editing <i>the Vim way</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Knowing the basics is great, but the only way to learn them is consistent
    repetition.
    My recommendation is to
    <b>switch your production work to Vim as soon as possible</b>;
    don't wait for some magic time when you feel comfortable with Vim and
    ready, it won't happen.
    Note that <b>it will be very slow to start -- and this is fine</b>.
    By using Vim consistently, you'll develop muscle memory for the basics, and
    an intuition for how it works.
    You'll find things you know are possible but that you forget -- look these
    up as they come arise in VimTutor, online, or in Vim's outstanding
    <a href="https://vimhelp.org/">help pages</a>
    (also available with <code>:help</code>).
    Odds are, if you need to do something tedious while manipulating text,
    someone else has too, and it is likely already solved by a feature within
    Vim.
    </p>

    <p>
    My recommended learning method is cyclic:
    <ol>
      <li>Identify an area for improvement.
      <li>Apply one of Vim's features.
      <li>Implement this into your workflow <i>every time</i> you do this task.
      <li>Repeat.
    </ol>
    Improve at a pace you can handle without overwhelming yourself.
    Learn features gradually and as needed.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
    <p>
    Here are a handful of mistakes I've either committed myself or have
    frequently watched others commit.
    </p>

    <h3>Using arrow keys or mouse</h3>
    <p>
    This one's a little tricky, and some might say overkill.
    We've all been using arrow keys and the mouse since first using a computer,
    but causes lots of unnecessary hand movement.
    Using HJKL for movement prevents this by keeping both your hands on the home
    row at all times, and makes editing a lot faster.
    This may seem pedantic, but it feels very nice once you get comfortable with
    it.
    This is a case where you simply need to trust the Vim developers.
    I too was reluctant to adopt HJKL for movement, but I'm very glad I did.
    </p>

    <blockquote cite="https://vimhelp.org/usr_02.txt.html#hjkl"><code>
At first, it may appear that these commands were chosen at random.  After all,
who ever heard of using l for right?  But actually, there is a very good
reason for these choices: Moving the cursor is the most common thing you do in
an editor, and these keys are on the home row of your right hand.  In other
words, these commands are placed where you can type them the fastest
(especially when you type with ten fingers).
    </code></blockquote>

    <h3>Living in <code>insert</code> mode</h3>
    <p>
    I see this one a lot with beginners.
    They learned how add text with insert mode, and from there treat it like a
    standard editor: moving around with arrow keys, using the backspace key to
    delete text, etc.
    This is fine, but it takes away all advantages of using Vim.
    Insert mode should be used <i>exclusively</i> for when you are actively
    typing new text.
    The rest of the time should be in normal mode -- it is called <i>normal</i>
    after all.
    Learning how to utilize the power of normal mode is one of the first big
    hurdles to achieving proficiency with Vim.

    <h2>Some Helpful Tricks</h2>
    <p>
    Here are some of my favorite tricks I like to use to speed up my workflow.
    I haven't included examples, but many can be found online.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Regex search and replace
      <span style="float:right">
        <a href="https://vimhelp.org/change.txt.html#%3Asubstitute">
          <code>:help :substitute</code>
        </a>
      </span>
    </h3>
    <p>
    This is a big one.
    I find that I often need to make the same change to many items scattered
    around my file.
    A simple command of the form <code>:%s/&lt;find&gt;/&lt;replace&gt;/g</code>
    matches all instances of <code>&lt;find&gt;</code> and changes them to
    <code>&lt;replace&gt;</code>.
    What differentiates Vim's search and replace from others is that it uses
    powerful pattern-matching with
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">
      regular expressions</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Visual block mode
      <span style="float:right">
        <a href="https://vimhelp.org/visual.txt.html#visual-block">
          <code>:help visual-block</code>
        </a>
      </span>
    </h3>
    <p>
    Another super simple technique with many uses.
    Visual block mode allows you to select text in a rectangle.
    Sections of similar lines can be deleted simultaneously with <code>d</code>.
    By pressing <code>I</code> or <code>A</code>, text can be added in bulk to
    multiple lines at the same time.
    </p>

    <h3>
      The dot (<code>.</code>) command
      <span style="float:right">
        <a href="https://vimhelp.org/repeat.txt.html#single-repeat">
          <code>:help single-repeat</code>
        </a>
      </span>
    </h3>
    <p>
    The dot command is so simple, yet one of the most versatile commands Vim has
    to offer.
    Pressing the dot key in normal mode repeats the previously executed command.
    There are many uses to this, and it discussed at length in chapter 1 of
    <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition/">
      Practical Vim</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Windows
      <span style="float:right">
        <a href="https://vimhelp.org/windows.txt.html#windows">
          <code>:help windows</code>
        </a>
      </span>
    </h3>
    <p>
    By default, Vim only shows one file on the screen at a time.
    Using windows, Vim can display multiple files at once.
    <ul>
      <li> <code>&lt;C-W&gt; s</code> (ctrl-w followed by s) splits the screen
        horizontally.
      <li> <code>&lt;C-W&gt; v</code> splits the screen vertically.
      <li> <code>&lt;C-W&gt; c</code> closes the active window.
      <li> <code>&lt;C-W&gt;</code> followed by h, j, k, or l moves between
        windows.
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>
      Diff mode
      <span style="float:right">
        <a href="https://vimhelp.org/diff.txt.html#diff">
          <code>:help diff</code>
        </a>
      </span>
    </h3>
    <p>
    Diff mode shows two files side-by-side and highlights the differences
    between them.
    Diff mode can be entered on the command line by launching Vim with
    <code>vim -d file1 file2</code>, or inside Vim by running
    <code>vert diffsplit file2</code>.
    This allows for easy comparison of multiple related files and cherry-picking
    specific parts of each file to keep and which to change.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, when creating this page, I ended up with two similar but
    different HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> sections.
    Using diff mode, I was able to easily identify that I forgot to specify
    <code>charset="utf-8"</code> and I was missing a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>
    element for my GitHub.
    With both files open and the differences highlighted, I was able to quickly
    copy over the missing lines.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
    Many programmers often overlook Vim when selecting their editor.
    However, it is an extremely powerful tool for those of us that consistently
    edit plain text files.
    It has a steep learning curve, to be sure, but the benefit is immense.
    Vim is only as hard as you need it to be.
    Identify what you want to learn, then learn it gradually, just a few
    keybinds at a time.
    Get comfortable with those, then learn a few more.
    You'll be flying around files in no time.
