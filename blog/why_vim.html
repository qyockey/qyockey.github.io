    <h1>Why Learn Vim?  And How?</h1>
    <p>Written 2025-12-16</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
    I have been actively using Vim for the past 4 years now.  I use Vim pretty
    much any time I write text: coding, drafting emails, writing web pages for
    this blog, etc.  Vim is an extremely powerful and feature-packed text editor
    developed to maximize efficiency of editing files.  There is a notoriously
    steep learning curve, but for those of us that edit lots of text, the reward 
    is immense.
    <b>
    If you are a computer scientists or electrical engineer, you will edit plain
    text for the rest of your career, so it is worth learning a tool to edit
    plain text fast!
    </b>
    </p>

    <h2>Limitations of Classic Editors</h2>
    <p>
    Many people I have spoken with haven't put much thought into the editor they
    use.  Some pick the default editor provided to them, others choose a
    powerful
    <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr> with an
    intuitive interface.  

    This allows for a comfortable editing experience, but sacrifices the ability
    to rapidly make complex changes.  Manipulation is where Vim shines.  Most
    time in software development is spent editing code, not writing it.  These
    changes are often repetitive: rename all occurrences of a variable, indent a
    block of code, ... TODO
    </p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>
    On Linux, install <code>vim</code> from your distribution's package manager
    or <a href="https://www.vim.org/git.php">compile from source</a>.
    For Mac or Windows, see Vim's official
    <a href="https://www.vim.org/download.php">download page</a>.

    <h2>How to Learn Vim</h2>
    <p>
    So, how can you start learning this incredible tool?  As it turns out,
    there's already a <b>great resource: <i>VimTutor</i></b>.
    To access the VimTutor on Linux, simply run <code>vimtutor</code> in your
    terminal.  Mac and Windows should have similar functionality.
    This teaches the basics of the editor, covering the fundamentals first so
    that you can get up and <s>running</s> moving as fast as possible.
    The estimated time to complete the tutorial is 30 minutes, but it may well
    take longer.
    There's a lot of information, so don't worry about getting everything right
    away.
    For now, focus on taking away the basics of file editing <i>the Vim way</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Knowing the basics is great, but the only way to learn them is consistent
    repetition.  My recommendation is to
    <b>switch your production work to Vim as soon as possible</b>;
    don't wait for some magic time when you feel comfortable with Vim and
    ready, it won't happen.  Note that
    <b>it will be very slow to start -- and this is fine</b>.
    By using Vim consistently, you'll develop muscle memory for the basics, and
    an intuition for how it works.
    You'll find things you know are possible but that you forget -- look these
    up as they come arise in VimTutor, online, or in Vim's outstanding
    <a href="https://vimhelp.org/">help pages</a>
    (also available with <code>:help</code>).
    Odds are, if you need to do something tedious while manipulating text,
    someone else has too, and it is likely already solved by a feature within
    Vim.
    </p>

    <p>
    My recommended learning method is cyclic:
    <ol>
      <li>Identify an area for improvement.
      <li>Apply one of Vim's features.
      <li>Implement this into your workflow <i>every time</i> you do this task.
      <li>Repeat.
    </ol>
    Improve at a pace you can handle without overwhelming yourself.
    Learn features gradually and as needed.

    <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
    <p>
    Here are a handful of mistakes I've either committed myself or have
    frequently watched others commit.
    </p>

    <h3>Learning too much at once</h3>
    <p>
    </p>

    <h3>Not learning enough</h3>
    <p>
    </p>

    <h3>Using arrow keys</h3>
    <p>
    This one's a little tricky, and some might say overkill.
    We've all been using arrow keys since we first held a keyboard.  
    However, using the arrow keys for all movement results in repeated movements
    of the entire right hand from the home row to 
    </p>

    <blockquote cite="https://vimhelp.org/usr_02.txt.html#hjkl"><code>
At first, it may appear that these commands were chosen at random.  After all,
who ever heard of using l for right?  But actually, there is a very good
reason for these choices: Moving the cursor is the most common thing you do in
an editor, and these keys are on the home row of your right hand.  In other
words, these commands are placed where you can type them the fastest
(especially when you type with ten fingers).
